    This folder consists of all the system verilog files to test the basic 
  encrypt/decrypt functionality of aes/gcm engine. 

  List of Files :
  =============
  gcm_dpi.sv   - DPI calls to interface with c-files.

  gcm_test.sv  - Sample test to check the basic encrypt/decrypt functionality.
               - Test creates a pkt stream of 64 bytes.
               - Sets all the variables needed for gcm_crypt DPI calls.
               - Encrypts and add the authentication (ICV) tag to the pkt.
               - Decrypts the encrypted pkt.
               - Decrypt pkt minus ICV should match with the original pkt.
               - Auth tag of both encrypted and decrypted pkt should compare.

  log/gcm_test.log - Sample log file from the simualtion 

  scripts/run_gcm  - run script to generate the simulation.
                   - This script needs to be changed so that it points to correct 
                     VCS version and path
               
  NOTE :
  ++++
    VCS (Version D-2009.12) is used to run the simualtion. 
    Other simualators may not work.
